# Software Engineering

This repository is my documentation of my journey of learning, best practices and conventions

I grew up in Imphal, a small town in North-East India, where most people aim for government jobs as the safest career choice. But I decided to take a different path and follow my passion for technology, choosing a career as a Computer Science Engineer.

> “When you discover your mission, you will feel its demand. It will fill you with enthusiasm and a burning desire to get to work on it.” — W. Clement Stone

After finishing high school in my hometown, I moved to Chandigarh to study Computer Science and work toward my dream. This journey made me a first-generation entrepreneur and a software engineer driven to create meaningful solutions.

Today, I work as a software engineer in Bengaluru, India, at a startup that helps businesses manage their operations and human resources globally.

# 💡 Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>1. What is an API (Application Programming Interface)?</strong></summary>

An application programming interface is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.

#### Key Points:
- Acts as a bridge between different computer programs
- Provides a structured way to share data and functionality
- Comes with detailed specifications for implementation
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. What is an SDK (Software Development Kit)?</strong></summary>

An SDK is just a pre-packaged set of code (for a specific language) that you don’t have to write yourself.Sometimes free and sometimes you have to, purchase them.There are all sorts of other SDKs out there including things like an SDK to simplify building a User Interface.

#### Key Points:
- Pre-built code for specific programming languages
- Can be free or paid
- Potential downsides:
  - Large file sizes
  - May include unused functionality
  - Potential security risks
  
#### Best Practice:
> 💡 Prefer open-source SDKs when possible for better security and transparency
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. What is a Framework?</strong></summary>

A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need.

_Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about._

#### Key Points:
- Provides basic architecture
- Controls program flow
- Examples:
  - Web application systems
  - Plugin managers
  - GUI systems
  
#### Key Characteristic:
> 💡 Frameworks follow the "inversion of control" principle - they call your code, rather than you calling them
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. What is a Library?</strong></summary>

**TL;DR:** A collection of pre-written code for specific operations.

#### Common Examples:
- Network protocols
- Compression utilities
- Image manipulation
- String utilities
- Math operations

#### Key Characteristic:
> 💡 Libraries are called by your code, giving you more control over program flow

<summary><strong>5. Relational vs Non-Relational Databases</strong></summary>



1. Relational Database : RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is most popular database. In it, data is store in the form of row that is in the form of tuple. It contain numbers of table and data can be easily accessed because data is store in the table. This Model was proposed by E.F. Codd.

2. Non Relational (NoSQL) :
NoSQL Database stands for a non-SQL database. NoSQL database doesn’t use table to store the data like relational database. It is used for storing and fetching the data in database and generally used to store the large amount of data. It supports query language and provides better performance.

#### Quick Comparison:

| Feature | Relational (SQL) | Non-Relational (NoSQL) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Data Velocity | Low | High |
| Scalability | Read-only | Read & Write |
| Data Type | Structured | Any |
| Reliability | Single point of failure | No single point of failure |
| Deployment | Vertical | Horizontal |

#### Extended Comparison:

<summary><strong>7. What is the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) Model?</strong></summary>

The Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model is a data modeling approach used to represent complex and dynamic data structures. In this model, data is organized into three components: entities, attributes, and values.

- Entities: These are objects or concepts that are being described in the model. Examples of entities could be customers, products, orders, or any other object of interest.
- Attributes: These are characteristics or properties of the entities being described. Examples of attributes for a customer entity could be name, address, or email address.
- Values: These are the specific values associated with each attribute for each entity. For example, for the customer entity, the name attribute may have the value "John Smith," while the address attribute may have the value "123 Main Street."
The EAV model is useful in situations where there is a need for flexibility in data modeling, such as when dealing with data that has many optional attributes, or when the attributes of an entity can change frequently. However, it can also lead to complex queries and difficulty in maintaining data integrity. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.

Here's an example of how an EAV model could be represented in a table format.

Let's say we have a simple online store that sells books, and we want to store information about each book in our database. In a traditional database design, we would create a table with columns for each attribute of the book, such as title, author, publisher, ISBN, etc. However, in an EAV model, we would create three tables: one for entities, one for attributes, and one for values.

Here are the tables we would create:

#### Entity Table:

| entity_id | entity_type | 
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Book        |
| 2         | Book        |

#### Attribute Table : 

| attribute_id | attribute_name |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | Title          |
| 2            | Author         |
| 3            | Publisher      |
| 4            | ISBN           |

#### Enitity Table: 

| entity_id | attribute_id | value                                    |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1         | 1            | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone |
| 1         | 2            | J.K. Rowling                             |
| 1         | 3            | Bloomsbury Publishing                    |
| 1         | 4            | 0747532699                               |
| 2         | 1            | The Catcher in the Rye                   |
| 2         | 2            | J.D. Salinger                            |
| 2         | 3            | Little, Brown and Company                |
| 2         | 4            | 0316769487                               |

In this example, the Entity Table contains two rows representing two different books, each with a unique entity_id. The Attribute Table lists the different attributes we want to store for each book, such as title, author, publisher, and ISBN, each with a unique attribute_id. The Value Table contains rows for each combination of entity_id and attribute_id, along with the value associated with that combination.

For instance, the first row in the Value Table tells us that for the book with entity_id 1, the title attribute has the value "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", the author attribute has the value "J.K. Rowling", the publisher attribute has the value "Bloomsbury Publishing", and the ISBN attribute has the value "0747532699". Similarly, the second row in the Value Table tells us that for the book with entity_id 2, the title attribute has the value "The Catcher in the Rye", the author attribute has the value "J.D. Salinger", the publisher attribute has the value "Little, Brown and Company", and the ISBN attribute has the value "0316769487".
